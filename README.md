Code repo for my 3rd year Dissertation investigating the use of steganography techniques in order to hide sensitive and personal patient data within medical images for more secure and convenient transfer of such data. 

This repo has code for both basic LSB steganography and more complex techniques and was used to analyse the cost and performance benefit between them all as well as analyse the overall usefulness in the medical field.
